# Node-To-Meet-You

In this project I was tasked with creating a Readme that was generated from the command line using node, axios and inquirer. The user was prompted to answer questions pertaining to the project title, a description of the project, link to GitHub account, etc. These questions would then be written to a file that had the information set up as a standard ReadMe file.
